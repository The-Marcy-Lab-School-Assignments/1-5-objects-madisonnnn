# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by reference means that the it's mutable and passed by value means you can't edit the value directly but have to reassign it which means it's not mutable.

You are correct. In addition, pass by reference means that the value directly references the location in memory of a value which is why it is mutable. Pass by value will just pass in the value of a variable not the actual location.
